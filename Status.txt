1) Numeric Values, and Enum values are solved for Add Individual and Update Individual
2) Fixed: merging the individuals, when the individual already exists
3) Fixed: Eum in Query Individuals
4) Cardinalities of super classes are added
5) Added Compare Blueprints use case with statistical information, summary and CSV download 
6) Fixed the Type issue in Add Individual (NamedIndividual is added automatically), and update individual (disabled' cant add; can't remove)
7) Query Individuals use case: a) fixed adding multiple rows for numeric values, even if thier max cardinalities is 1, to enable inequalties search
8) Included inverse object properties by utilizing a reasoning model

9) support main direction for inverse object properties;i.e., add only from the main direction, display only in other use cases
10) Not important: in Delete Individual use case, data propeties doesnt show muli-values
11) Done: To fix: Update Individual use case: fix inverse properties table and inverse properties not showing for some classes (e.g., University class)
12) Not important TODO: Sort drop down lists 
13) created a first version of NARRATE-blueprints Ontology
14)✅ Proper handling of xsd:date, xsd:dateTime, and xsd:anyURI.
✅ Correct enforcement of xsd:string for textual data (even when numbers are entered!).
✅ No more datatype inconsistencies in Protégé.
✅ Clean RDF output, ready for validators, reasoners, and real-world use.
✅ Full respect for your OWL definitions — no guessing types anymore.
✅ Smart date auto-completion (T00:00:00) for xsd:dateTime.
15) Adding tooltips
16) Done: Ordering properties semantically (through displayOrder metadata in the OWL ontology. The code currently only supports data properties)
17) Resolved: Customer and SalesOrder class give error in AddIndividual use case
18) TODO: Update Query Blueprints use case:
✅ Proper handling of xsd:date, xsd:dateTime, and xsd:anyURI.
✅ Correct enforcement of xsd:string for textual data (even when numbers are entered!).
✅ No more datatype inconsistencies in Protégé.
✅ Clean RDF output, ready for validators, reasoners, and real-world use.
✅ Full respect for your OWL definitions — no guessing types anymore.
✅ Smart date auto-completion (T00:00:00) for xsd:dateTime.
✅ Adding tooltips and order data properties based on displayOrder metadata

19) Done: to consider reasoned model in update Individual use case, also in query and compose use cases 
20) DONE: in OWL, BOM should also have quantity or any measuring units for the needed materials-> introduced MaterialUsage as an Association class
21) TODO: resolve xsd:date and xsd:datetime issue (display datetime option in the UI)
22) TODO: Include certification in the Bespoke COT scenario -> Partially, Material Supplier and Product
23) Fixed Query Individual: ordering data properties, comments as tooltips, inline expandable rows for results objects properties
24) TODO: Query Individual: Some classes, like DeliverySchedule, it doesnt link into object properties
25) Compare blueprints:
    a) Load reasoned model
    b) display order
    c) selection of comparision criteria
    d) fix display table when three rows
